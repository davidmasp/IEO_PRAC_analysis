## What is prostate cancer?

[Prostate cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer)
is a disease of the prostate, a walnut-size gland in the male
reproductive system.  Nearly all prostate cancer is prostate adenocarcinoma.
 Prostate cancer is graded based on its Gleason score, which is how the cells
 look under a microscope and ranges from two to ten. A low Gleason score means
 that the cancer tissue is similar to normal cells and unlikely to spread. A
 high Gleason score means that the cancer cells are very different from normal
 cells and are likely to spread. For patients whose cancer has spread, their
 survival time is usually one to three years. It was estimated that for 2011,
 240,890 men would be diagnosed and 33,720 would die from prostate cancer.
